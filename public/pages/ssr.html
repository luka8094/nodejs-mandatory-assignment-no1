       <h2>Client Side Rendering</h2>
       <p><span class="code-highlight">Client Side Rendering</span> (CSR) is when the server responds with the individual web files on a given request. First it will dispatch the <span class="code-highlight">document object model</span> (DOM) structure meaning the HTML markup, followed by the styling and then functionality. All these will be rendered in a user's (client) browser.</p>
       <p>In other words, the user's browser is responsible for rendering a given website and its content.</p>
