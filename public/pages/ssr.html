       <p><span class="code-highlight">Client Side Rendering</span> (CSR) is when the server responds with delivering the individual files, that make up the website's entirety, upon a given fetch request. First the servers dispatches the base <span class="code-highlight">document object model</span> (DOM) structure, meaning the HTML then the styling (CSS) followed by the functionality (JavaScript). All these will be rendered in a user's (client) browser.</p>
