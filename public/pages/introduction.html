        <h2>Variables in Javascript</h2>
        <p>Lets handle some fundamental Javascript syntax first.</p>
        <p>In Javascript you can declare variable through three different keywords: <span class="code-highlight">var</span>, <span class="code-highlight">let</span>, and <span class="code-highlight">const</span>.
    
        <p>The keyword <span class="code-highlight">let</span> has a restrained block specific local scope. This means its only accessible within the boundaries of where the variable been declared. In other words, the variable will remain only known to area of a given code block. The value of a let variable can be modifed on the fly. In other words, the value is <span class="code-highlight">mutable</span>.
        </p>
        <p>However, the <span class="code-highlight">const</span> keyword is used to declare and hold values that can not be overwritten or be Modified. However, the value itself can serve as a base in combination with other variables. 
        Its practical to contain values you'd consider read-only. This phenomenon is known as <span class="code-highlight">immutability</span>.</p>
        <p>Below are examples on how to declare variable by each keyword. Its recommended to use <span class="code-highight">const</span> whenever possible to define values.</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <code>let apple = "apple";</code>
            </figure>
            <p class="example-text">Above is the syntax to declare a let variable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            </figure>
            <p class="example-text">The code snippet above show a const variable with the numeric value 3.14.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <code>var global = "I'm all over the place!";</code>
            </figure>
            <p class="example-text">Above shows the declaration of a var variable.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Its important to note that these keywords serve different purposes. Its common practice to avoid using <span class="code-highlight">var</span> keyword and substitute it with let and const whenever possible despite having var at your disposal.
        A reason being is that its an outdated approach and the scope of the keyword can cause a domino effect of complications and difficulties with code maintainability, transparency and tracibility.</p>
        <p>A common error is to delcare a loop incrementer with the<span class="code-highlight">var</span> keyword. The accesibility of the variable still breaches the boundary of the loop.</p>
        <p>In case of loops, its advised to use always <span class="code-highlight">let</span> over var when iterating over collections, Like for example an array.</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <pre>
                    <code>
for(var i = 0; 0 < 10; i++){
    
    //this is bad practice! 

}

console.log(i) //the variable i can be reached here

for(let j = 0; 0 < 10; j++){
    
    //this solves the possible unpredictability 
    //and uncertainity of using var

}

console.log(j) //the variable j is unreachable
                    </code>
                </pre>        
            </figure>
            <p class="example-text">The upper should be avoided example should in for or while-loops.</p>
        </div>
        <p>All the keywords mentioned here are capable of holding all the <span class="code-highlight">primitive data types</span>: string, numeric values, and boolean logic. Additionally, Javascript variables can contain custom defined objects, functions, and data structures as well.</p>

        <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p>This section will go over define objects within a Javascript context.</p>

let monke = {
    "name" : "gojira",
    "food" : "banana smoothie"
}    

console.log(monke.name) //this will print "gojira" in the console

        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>In regular Javascript syntax, blocks of code that fulfill a specific task or a task are declared by using the <span class="code-highlight">function</span> keyword. Such as shown below.</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <pre>
                    <code>
function someFunction(){

    console.log("This a basic function")

}

function anotherFunction(argument){

    if(argument){
        console.log("another function with a parameter")
    }

}
                    </code>
                </pre>        
            </figure> 
            <p class="example-text">Basic function examples.</p> 
        </div> 
        <h2>Arrow functions</h2> 
        <p>In the prior section the common way of defining functions was described. However, in some circumstance we can write more brief functions called <span class="code-highlight">arrow</span> or, also known as, <span class="code-highlight">anonymous</span> functions. Alternatively, they're also known as a <span class="code-highlight">Lambda expressions</span> in other languages (derived from the mathematics of Lambda calculus).</p>
        
        <!-- usefyl source about the dicussion of referential transparency : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/210835/what-is-referential-transparency -->
        <p>This logic stems from the concept of <span class="code-highlight">Referential transparency</span>, which essentially means "replacing an expression with something of equal meaning". With this concept we can condense the code syntax and be more concise in how we express sequences of logic.</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <pre>
                    <code>
//Regular notation for function(s) without arrows
function aFunction(argument){

    if(argument){
        console.log("the argument was true")
    }

}

//with arrows
function(e) => { 
    if(e){
        console.log("the argument e was evaluated")
    }
}

(e) => {

    if(e){
        console.log("the argument was also evaluated here")
    }

}

() => console.log("direct anonymous function call")

                    </code>
                </pre>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <h2>Callbacks</h2>
        <p>A callback is a "function reference" and a way for which functions can take other function as an arguments.</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <pre>
                    <code>

htmlElement.onclick = callOnMe

function callOnMe(){

    console.log("Callback through an arrow function")

}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </figure>
