        <h2>Variables in Javascript</h2>
        <p>Before we venture into NodeJS lets discuss some fundamental Javascript first.
        In Javascript syntax its possibe to declare value through three different keywords: <span class="code-highlight">var</span>, <span class="code-highlight">let</span>, and <span class="code-highlight">const</span>.
        Its important to note that they all have difference means and purpose. Its common, if not best, practice to avoid <span class="code-highlight">var</span> keyword and use let and const in most case.
        One of the reason is due the scope of var keyword which could lead to conflicts and difficulties in code maintainability.</p>
        <p><span class="code-highlight">let</span> has a block specific local scope which avoids this issue. Which means its only accessible within the scope that its been declared.
        </p>
        <p><span class="code-highlight">const</span> is used to declare and hold values that not be overwritten or be Modified. However, the value itself can be used as a base in combination with other variables.
        Its primarily useful to carry or contain immutable values. Below are examples on how to declare variable by each keyword. A best practice is use <span class="code-highight">const</span> whenever possible over the keywords at your disposal.</p>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <code>let apple = "apple";</code>
            </figure>
            <p class="example-text">Above is the syntax to declare a let variable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            </figure>
            <p class="example-text">The code snippet above show a const variable with the numeric value 3.14.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <figure>
                <code>var global = "I'm all over the place!";</code>
            </figure>
            <p class="example-text">Above shows the declaration of a var variable.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>In regular Javascript syntax, blocks of code that fulfill a specific task or a task are declared by using the <span class="code-highlight">function</span> keyword.</p>
        <p>Such as shown below.</p>
        <figure>
            <code>
                function someFunction(){
                    console.log("This a basic function")
                }
            </code>
        </figure>

        <p>Callbacks in are "method references" where a function takes another function as an argument.<span class="code-highlight">Referential transparency</span></p>
        <figure>
            <code>
                () => console.log("Callback through an arrow function")
            </code>
        </figure>
